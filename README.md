# text-davinci-003_bot


# Bot

The system serves as a bot which can answer almost all the questions and queries. It was built using the API of one of the powerful language model(text-davinci-003) of OpenAI. The system takes input in the form of text and displays the corresponding output in the same format i.e text.


# About the model
Davinci is the most capable model family and can perform any task the other models can perform and often with less instruction. For applications requiring a lot of understanding of the content, like summarization for a specific audience and creative content generation, Davinci is going to produce the best results. These increased capabilities require more compute resources, so Davinci costs more per API call and is not as fast as the other models.

Another area where Davinci shines is in understanding the intent of text. Davinci is quite good at solving many kinds of logic problems and explaining the motives of characters. Davinci has been able to solve some of the most challenging AI problems involving cause and effect.

text-davinci-003 is one of the most capable GPT-3 model. It can do any task the other models can do, often with higher quality, longer output and better instruction-following. It also supports inserting completions within text.
